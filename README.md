# Forest-Fire-Detection
This project demonstrates the detection of forest fires using CNN and Image Processing concepts. 

We use a Inception V3 CNN network as it achieves better accuracy and can compute results quicker compared to other CNN networks.

This model has an accuracy of 95%.

We can detect forest fire with the help of CCTV camera's. The live feed can be converted into image frames and image processing and deep learning techniques can be applied to these random image frames to detect the presence of fire.

The dataset used is a particular section from imagenet named Fire-Smoke-Dataset.

In the end i have tested the correctness and accuracy of this project by uploading some random fire pictures and some non fire pictures and it classfies the images well.
